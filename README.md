Dissertation Project: Connected Car as a Platform for Accident Detection and Response

The connected car is revolutionising the way that cars interact with the real world by
providing various methods of communication to all manner of things, from other cars
to road infrastructure. It has become equally important to understand the number of
road traffic accidents which occur every year. This research aims to produce a small
scale replicate of the connected car with a limited budget in order to understand
how different component technologies fit together and how GPS co-ordinate data
can be generated when a road accident occurs. The success of this project is bound
upon the integration of: networking, cloud, wireless, and GSM technologies coupled
with a programmable Arduino board which enables the data to be created, stored,
read and communicated to the necessary parties, in this case the end user. This is a
demonstration of the amalgamation of technical elements as a proof of concept for
a system that could be involved with both older vehicles along with new vehicles.
